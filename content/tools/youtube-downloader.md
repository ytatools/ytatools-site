# YouTube Downloader

## Overview

A desktop application that replaces online downloaders like cobalt.tools with a privacy-first, self-hosted solution. Built in Go with a native GUI, it provides different feature tiers based on sponsorship status.

## Current Status: In Development ðŸš§

The downloader is currently being migrated from Python to Go to solve build size issues and improve performance. The core architecture is complete, with GUI implementation underway.

## Architecture

- **Desktop App**: Cross-platform Go application with Fyne GUI
- **Authentication**: Integrates with local and cloud auth services
- **Storage**: SQLite with encryption for local data
- **Backend**: yt-dlp wrapper with creator-focused enhancements

## User Tiers

### Free Users
- 1080p video downloads
- Basic GUI interface  
- Local file management

### Premium Users (Sponsors)
- 4K video downloads
- Playlist downloads with organization
- Complete metadata extraction
- Subtitle generation with Whisper AI
- REST API for automation
- MCP server for AI integration

Premium features unlock automatically when you {{< support-link "support the project" >}} via {{< github-link "GitHub Sponsors" >}} or {{< patreon-link "Patreon" >}}.

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **GUI Framework**: Fyne v2
- **Database**: SQLite with encryption
- **Download Engine**: yt-dlp
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux

### Privacy Features
- **Local-first**: All data stays on your machine
- **OAuth2 without storage**: Authentication via token exchange
- **GDPR compliant**: No personal data collection

## Why Not Just Use yt-dlp?

While yt-dlp is excellent, we add:
- **User-friendly GUI** for non-technical users
- **Sponsorship verification** for feature gating
- **Creator workflows** like playlist organization
- **Metadata management** for content analysis
- **AI integration** via MCP server

## Roadmap

- **Q4 2024**: Core Go implementation complete
- **Q1 2025**: Beta release for supporters
- **Q2 2025**: Public release with basic features
- **Q3 2025**: Advanced AI features and automation

## Technical Preview

Currently available as a command-line tool for supporters. GUI implementation in progress. {{< github-link "Join our community" >}} for early access and updates.
