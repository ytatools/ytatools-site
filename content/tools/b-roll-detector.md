# B-Roll Detector

## Overview

Automatically analyze video content to identify A-roll (talking head/main content) and B-roll (supplementary footage) sections. Perfect for creators who want to optimize their content structure and editing workflow.

## Current Status: Planned ðŸŽ¯

This tool is in the conceptual phase. Development will begin after core infrastructure tools are stable. Research and prototyping happening in parallel with other tools.

## The Problem

Content creators spend hours manually:
- Identifying which parts of videos need B-roll coverage
- Analyzing competitor video structures
- Finding optimal pacing and scene transitions
- Creating engaging content flow

## Our Solution

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Scene detection**: Automatically segment videos by content type
- **Speaker identification**: Detect when someone is talking vs. showing content
- **Visual classification**: Identify different types of shots and angles
- **Pacing analysis**: Measure scene length and transition patterns

### Content Structure Insights
- **Engagement mapping**: Correlate scene types with retention
- **Optimal pacing**: Recommend scene length based on successful content
- **B-roll suggestions**: Identify sections that need additional footage
- **Hook analysis**: Detect strong opening moments

### Export & Integration
- **Timeline formats**: Export to Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve
- **JSON data**: Custom integrations and analysis tools
- **Visual reports**: Human-readable content breakdowns
- **Batch processing**: Analyze entire content libraries

## Use Cases

### For Individual Creators
- **Content audit**: Analyze your existing videos for improvement opportunities
- **Competitor research**: Study successful creators' content structures
- **Editing optimization**: Speed up post-production with automated scene detection
- **Performance correlation**: Link content structure to audience retention

### For Content Teams
- **Quality standards**: Establish consistent content structure guidelines
- **Editor briefings**: Provide detailed scene breakdowns to editors
- **A/B testing**: Compare different content structures systematically
- **Trend analysis**: Identify what content structures work best

## Technical Approach

### Planned Architecture
- **Language**: Python with Go wrapper for performance
- **AI Models**: Custom-trained scene classification models
- **Processing**: GPU acceleration for batch video analysis
- **Storage**: Local processing, no cloud uploads required

### Privacy & Self-Hosting
- **Local processing**: Videos never leave your infrastructure
- **Custom models**: Train on your content style and niche
- **No API calls**: Complete offline operation
- **Batch optimization**: Process entire libraries efficiently

## Competitive Landscape

Current tools are either:
- **Too generic**: Basic scene detection without creator focus
- **Cloud-only**: Privacy concerns and upload requirements
- **Expensive**: Enterprise pricing for simple functionality
- **Limited**: Single-video processing only

## Roadmap

- **Q3 2025**: Research and model training begin
- **Q4 2025**: Core detection algorithms
- **Q1 2026**: Desktop application with GUI
- **Q2 2026**: Editor integrations and advanced features

## Research Areas

Currently exploring:
- **Computer vision models** for scene classification
- **Audio analysis** for speaker/content detection
- **Retention correlation** algorithms
- **Export format optimization**
